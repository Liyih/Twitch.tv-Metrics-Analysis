    "**Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "With the growth of live streaming as an entertainment platform, coronavirus has presented a strong opportunity for online streaming platforms to expand and grow. We want to track this growth and how growth is displayed among the creators in Twitch. Understanding Twitch’s growth and live streaming as a career field is important to those looking into streaming as a viable at-home, virtual job, and predicting measures of growth and success. We will create an expected projection of Twitch channels over the next year on a monthly basis of viewership and other metrics, which will be used in parallel with subscriber data to project expected income growth. We also want to gain insight into the jump in viewership due to coronavirus and better understand the rise of the streaming industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Significance of the Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "Live streaming is an industry that is quickly growing in the technology space. Following Twitch’s initial success in the early 2010s, Youtube (via Youtube Live), Facebook (Facebook/Instagram Live) and other major platforms have followed up by creating their own streaming platforms for content creators. Insights into Twitch’s growth potential can quantify the growth of live streaming and their platforms as a brand new career field with opportunities for people to look into. Tracking the projected growth of a fast-moving industry in live streaming can be really useful for choosing a job as a software or data engineer, as joining one of these companies can be particularly lucrative. Alternatively, should investment opportunities present themselves in the future, having an understanding of YoY growth and metric-backed expectations can lead to potentially rewarding investments. Finally, if someone were to come across the expected growth and data and were interested in becoming a livestreamer themselves, they could use the projected data to measure their own metrics and success.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Previous Work on the Topic**\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the analysis done around Twitch.tv’s data is in regards to the platform as a whole. Students from WPI found relationships between the demographics and the viewership behavior in relation to the types and formats of the content being delivered (Farrington and Muesch). Other breakdowns look at aggregate metrics for Twitch, such as the numbers of broadcasters and peak viewership in order to generate a tentative estimate of Twitch’s revenue (Iqbal). Even recommendations for marketing managers and potential influencers are presented with aggregate data metrics (Influencer Marketing Hub). Given the background of Twitch as a relatively new platform, we were unable to find any analysis on specific channels or the application of machine learning methods to predict singular channel growth. Identifying this gap and realizing its potential, we set out to create models that would allow us to explore Twitch through the lens of singular channels and learn from applying ML methods to real data.\n",

Next, we adjusted the channel names as, in some instances, the foreign name and the English name of the channel would appear in the data. We cleaned it so that only the English name appeared, which would then be used by the subscriber scraper. \n",

    "* Five machine learning algorithms were analyzed: Multiple Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, k-Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Machine. They were analyzed in four different situations: analyzing all features including followers, all features excluding followers, selected features including followers, and selected features excluding followers.\n",
    "* Among all conditions, Support Vector Machine performed the worst by having negative R-squared values for all condition. k-Nearest Neighbor also did not perform well as it consistently had a negative R-squared value for the testing set in all conditions. \n",
    "* Multiple Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso had the best results out of the five algorithms. They performed the best when analyzing all features and including followers. In that situation, they had an R-squared value of 0.186 for training and 0.355 for testing data.\n",
    "* All models are at risk of underfitting as the R-squared for training data is less than the R-squared for testing data. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Questions\n",
    "* The most important feature identified in predicting future income growth of Twitch channels via model based feature selection was Followers. However, when graphing the regression line, it resulted in a slope of 0.0002. In addition, we believed the data for Followers was corrupt in the dataset. So, to account for this, we also performed machine learning algorithms on features selections that excluded “Followers”.\n",
    "* From the model based feature selection, it was found that the ideal number of features to include in analysis was 5 features. However, when performing machine learning algorithms, higher R-squared was achieved when analyzing with all features rather than with the selected features. \n",
    "* The supervised machine learning algorithms that produced the highest accuracy were Multiple Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "* **Hypotheses 1:** Followers gained was not the most influential feature in predicting income growth. Through iterative feature selection, the list of features in order of importance of influence to the target variable of income growth were shown. Followers was considered most important, as it was at the top of the list. Thus, hypotheses 1 is rejected and it can be concluded that followers gained is not the most influential feature in predicting income growth. \n",
    "* **Hypotheses 2:** The regression line on the scatter plot comparing stream time and income change is shown to have the equation of approximately y =.096x -1567. This shows a small but positive relationship between stream time and income change. However, the ANOVA shows that the p value of the relationship does not pass the assumption of normality as it has a p value of less than 0.05, thus no significant positive relationship exists. Thus, hypothesis 2 is rejected and it can be concluded that stream time has no relationship with income growth. \n",
    "* **Hypothesis 3:** Through ANOVA analysis of views gained and income growth, hypothesis 3 is rejected as the data does not pass the assumption of normality because the p value is less than 0.05. Thus, it can be concluded that no relationship exists between views gained and income growth\n"
