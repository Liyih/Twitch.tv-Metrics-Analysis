    "**Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "With the growth of live streaming as an entertainment platform, coronavirus has presented a strong opportunity for online streaming platforms to expand and grow. We want to track this growth and how growth is displayed among the creators in Twitch. Understanding Twitch’s growth and live streaming as a career field is important to those looking into streaming as a viable at-home, virtual job, and predicting measures of growth and success. We will create an expected projection of Twitch channels over the next year on a monthly basis of viewership and other metrics, which will be used in parallel with subscriber data to project expected income. We want to gain insight into the jump in viewership due to coronavirus and better understand the rise of the streaming industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Significance of the Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "Live streaming is an industry that is quickly growing in the technology space. Following Twitch’s initial success in the early 2010s, Youtube (via Youtube Live), Facebook (Facebook/Instagram Live) and other major platforms have followed up by creating their own streaming platforms for content creators. Insights into Twitch’s growth potential can quantify the growth of live streaming and their platforms as a brand new career field with opportunities for people to look into. Tracking the projected growth of a fast-moving industry in live streaming can be really useful for choosing a job as a software or data engineer, as joining one of these companies can be particularly lucrative. Alternatively, should investment opportunities present themselves in the future, having an understanding of YoY growth and metric-backed expectations can lead to potentially rewarding investments. Finally, if someone were to come across the expected growth and data and were interested in becoming a livestreamer themselves, they could use the projected data to measure their own metrics and success.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Previous Work on the Topic**\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the analysis done around Twitch.tv’s data is in regards to the platform as a whole. Students from WPI found relationships between the demographics and the viewership behavior in relation to the types and formats of the content being delivered (Farrington and Muesch). Other breakdowns look at aggregate metrics for Twitch, such as the numbers of broadcasters and peak viewership in order to generate a tentative estimate of Twitch’s revenue (Iqbal). Even recommendations for marketing managers and potential influencers are presented with aggregate data metrics (Influencer Marketing Hub). Given the background of Twitch as a relatively new platform, we were unable to find any analysis on specific channels or the application of machine learning methods to predict singular channel growth. Identifying this gap and realizing its potential, we set out to create models that would allow us to explore Twitch through the lens of singular channels and learn from applying ML methods to real data.\n",

Next, we adjusted the channel names as, in some instances, the foreign name and the English name of the channel would appear in the data. We cleaned it so that only the English name appeared, which would then be used by the subscriber scraper. \n",
