    "With the growth of live streaming as an entertainment platform, coronavirus has presented a strong opportunity for online streaming platforms to expand and grow. We want to track this growth and how growth is displayed among the creators in Twitch. Understanding Twitch’s growth and live streaming as a career field is important to those looking into streaming as a viable at-home, virtual job, and predicting measures of growth and success. We will create an expected projection of Twitch channels over the next year on a monthly basis of viewership and other metrics, which will be used in parallel with subscriber data to project expected income. We want to gain insight into the jump in viewership due to coronavirus and better understand the rise of the streaming industry. \n",
